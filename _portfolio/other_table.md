Shou Sugi Ban is a method of waterproofing by charring wood planks. When I was charring the pine, I started with a small butane torch, which wasn't exactly efficient. I eventually had to buy a big blowtorch because the long charring sessions were giving me hand cramps. It all worked out as the process brought out the grain of the pine and gave the wood a nice tactile feel.
