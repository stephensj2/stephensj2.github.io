My mother had the treadle sitting around her house and told me to use it for this table. It was only after I had moved to Austin that I found out that she had planned to use the small treadle to build a coffee table at some point. As these short treadles are somewhat rare, I feel somewhat bad so if anyone happens to see one or have one they are willing to part with, please let me know!
